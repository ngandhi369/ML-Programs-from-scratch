# ML-Programs-from-scratch
* ### Basics machine learning programs from scratch - without using scikit-learn or any another libraries.
* ### Mainly used Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
* ### Most of the algorithms works on 'ml hello word' - iris dataset here.

### List of the programs:
1. Get used to with numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn.
2. Data preprocessing like normalization, standardization.
3. Linear regression using normal equation.
4. Linear regression using normal equation.
5. Logisitc regression.
6. KNN classification.
7. K-means clustering.
8. ID3 - Decision Tree.
9. CART - Decision Tree.
10. C4.5 - Decision Tree.
11. Support Vector Machine.
12. Neural Network.
13. Convolutional Neural Network.
+ Classfication using Tensorflow on MNIST dataset.
